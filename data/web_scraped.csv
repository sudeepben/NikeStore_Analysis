jason,Nike along with apple and coca cola supporting slavery in china,"""I read in the New York Times that Nike is fighting the passage of the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a bill that would ensure that forced Uighur labor isn't used in the making of parts you buy. That's gross, and I will absolutely stop buying your products if you continue to obstruct the bill's passage. Please pass this message along to leadership. Thanks.""",1,Bad,2020-12-22,3,United States

Alin Rosca,I've ordered some Jordans from Nike.com…,"I've ordered some Jordans from Nike.com on 30th September and my order got stuck in their NL Warehouse since then. In last month I've spoken every week with the customer support department, each agent told me the same story, that their finance department has to approve the request and they have to answer in 5-7 working days. Even if every time I call them, they can see that those days have passed several times, they just add a comment to that case and nothing is happening.I should read more carefully all other reviews about how Nike doesn't give a s**t about customers.",1,Bad,2020-12-01,5,United Kingdom
Soliel DeBella,I placed an order with Nike,"I placed an order with Nike, a very expensive one with customized shoes. After I placed the order I realized the computer changed my shoelace choice. I could easily buy my own and I did, but for $180 I went back in and it said I could look or modify the order...um, nope. you can't. I did the whole chat, totally useless, after waiting and talking about this and that, only to be told, ""only I can see the order, they cant' do anything on their end."" okay fine, I call...after waiting and being placed on hold three tiems, I was told the exact same thing. Mind you, this is an order placed within the half hour. You are telling me you can't modify my shoe lace choice for almost $200 pair of shoes that have yet to come close to be worked on? all I can say, is don't mess up and don't expect ""customer service' to do ANYTHING for you. If they can't even see your order or modify it, and anything you do you are told to cancel the order, wait and retry, you don't even need to pay them, just be honest on the site and not waste our time.",1,Bad,2020-12-01,1,United States
Martin Lopez,Nike Cheats People,"Nike customer service is rude, not sincere and tossed me around from one person to another. Ordered a couple of things on 11.11. Bank Transaction done. A week later i checked my account and saw that it was empty. Got in touch with customer service and she said transaction not found. Sent her copy of my bank statement that shows clearly Nike with the amount. Its no small amount. She keeps telling me she's sent proof of no transaction on nikes part. But the email has no attachment at all. This is the first online purchase from Nike from me and it will be the last. Nike is a big cheat. Stick with Adidas, puma and under armour.

Johan Rivera,Favorite brand on Earth,"I'm a little salty because like many of you, I miss out on alot of the coveted drops on the SNKRS app but I've also won my fair share of heat (coveted sneakers for the uninitiated) so you win some lose some. The shipping is almost always fast and quick (only complaint is slapping the nike logo on my shipping box, putting a bullseye on it for thieves). I've had to return items and also have had a quick and painless ordeal. The clearance section is decent, especially when they have the extra % off every few months or so.

Matthew,Lost a loyal customer - rude staff and internal process inadequate,"I have been a loyal Nike member since 2013 and ordered many of times over the years. I placed an order on the 31st August 2020 for a pair of trainers, which I paid with a gift voucher and applied a 25% promo at the time. 8th September I received an email to notify of delay in order due to stock. After speaking to several people, asking when it would be dispatched, they offered an extra 15% off as a gesture. (Acceptable at the time) however to this day it was still stuck 'In progress' when they had already put stock back on their website. 1 agent said they would email the warehouse to process the order quickly. Another agent told me they couldn't email the warehouse? I was also told that delayed orders are prioritised over new orders, but then another agent stated from their experience, cancelling the order and reordering again would be quicker!? I asked if a manager could call me to discuss the issue, as I cannot believe in 2020 no one can simply put a call/email into the warehouse to speed up a delivery which has been delayed significantly. Never received a call after being promised someone would call me on either the Saturday or Monday just gone. No emails received either. I then decided to call today to simply cancel the order and reorder, to my annoyance that I was told that they cannot honour the 25% promo code again but would have to reimburse, once Ive paid full price!? The worst part of this experience which topped it for me, I spoke to Ryan today, who in all my years of interaction with a customer service rep, have I spoke to someone who is so rude and confrontational. I was gobsmacked by his tone of voice, which was aggressive and he assumed upon previous notes, (He was very quick to tell me notes his colleague left). I am still shocked by the way he spoke to me. He is based in Dublin/Ireland where most of their customer service is. I have now cancelled and left short of order. - Goes well if stocks in place but if something delays, be prepared for a nightmare. If you want Nike products i would go via 3rd Parties and not direct because their clearly is no consequence for staff who act inappropriately.",1,Bad,2020-09-24,4,United Kingdom

Anastasia Reyes,Supports fraud horrible company,"One thing I will say about this company is that it's horrible. Allowing fraudulent purchases be viewed as authentic purchases. I've call 3 times about a purchase I never made and it is clear as freakin day that it was sent to a different location from were i have been living for 14yrs. Your company policy states it was an authentic order and if i want my money back I have to return the product. How can I return a product I never received nor did I order to know what it was to even return. You know who ordered the product why not charge them? go after them? since they technically didn't pay for YOUR products and just return the money that is mine that your customer used to fraudulently pay for your products. It's blatantly clear this company runs on absolute greed and fraud and doesn't care about actual justifiable facts.

It was intended to reference American Indian solidarity and unity, and to contrast these collected individuals with their “whiteskin” negotiating partners (e.g., the French, British, and former American colonists).",1,Bad,2020-07-03,2,United States

Sean DaCosta,Nike raffle 5/29 on SNKRS App,"Won a raffle on 5/29 from SNKRs app from Nike. Product paid for, it wasnt free. It was shipped to the wrong address but was scheduled to get there 5/11. I would have been able to receive it as that was the date it would arrive. When I checked the order 5/10 it was on its way back to Nike as it was returned.I called Nike cx care 5/10 to see if it could be shipped back. Cx care told me the supervisor will receive the order and send it back to me at either the UPS place to hold it or the address I would like. They said Monday i will receive an email for the order and where it will be shipped which would take 7 days. I called on 5/13 to verify and they didn't see anything on my profile or notes. This agent said he would get it to me no problems. Still haven't heard from Nike.I called 5/20 and was informed that the shoes are not available and when i asked about my pair that was promised by a supervisor and the other 2 agents, where did that specific pair go. I was just told there isn't any available once again. Worst cx experience I've had. If I was told from the beginning I wouldn't be able to get it back i would understand but from the early shipping to the misinformation I was given multiple times.

When I checked the tracking , it kept saying pending and didn’t update from when label wasn’t created. I called Nike customer service on May 26th. The wait time was only approximately 10 minutes which isn’t bad given Covid-19 phone times to see if they had any info and they checked the tracking and saw what I saw. They went on chat with Fed Ex and then  called Fed Ex themselves while I held,  and told me that due to flooding, their shipments were held up. I told the women my situation that I needed these no later May 30th as i was going away on May 31st. Luckily, they had my 2 items in stock and she immediately did another order and had it shipped express thru a different shipper so I would receive them in time. I haven’t gotten them yet but I received tracking within hours and they will be delivered tomorrow.

Natasha,A Shambles in Every Way,"Prior to this experience, I believed Nike to be a reputable and trustworthy brand. The level of disorganisation in their internal processes is unlike anything I have ever experienced before while shopping online. Their staff clearly don't care, and are not properly trained.- Non-existent care for customers. Staff purposefully end calls and online chat when they can't be bothered dealing with your query, forget to send appropriate paperwork, and accuse you of ignoring them when they fail to check their inboxes.- Inaccurate stock displayed online, resulting in cancelled orders without explanation or apology.- Online chat queues of routinely over 300 people, and a phone number that never connects.- Apparently zero complaints procedures or dispute resolution. Pure incompetence.- Clearly no interest in keeping customers. After receiving a pair of shoes ordered online at Nike.com, I reached out to Customer Care to request an exchange to the half-size down. A simple request, which led to waiting in a virtual queue of over 300 people, on five different occasions! A complete lack of organisation and competency meant that firstly, I was not sent the requested exchange return label, to then being sent the wrong return label, to my order then being cancelled due to ""no longer being available"", whilst still being' available to purchase' on their website. This will become a theme here.At this point, I had to rejoin the 300+ queue to make a complaint, and was offered an additional discount on top of the offer I had original used to purchased my shoes, as a form of apology. So after being reassured that there would be no further complications or hassles surrounding my purchase, I agreed to purchase the shoes once again. One week later, feeling wrongly confident that things were finally sorted, I receive that familiar ""cancelled due to no longer being available"" email, whist, you've guessed it, still being available to purchase online. This was the straw that broke the camels back and I was determined to make a formal complaint, I had wasted an inordinate amount of time. Over the course of an entire month of back and forth with Nike Customer Support, with no solution. Finally, number one in the queue again, I have never made a formal complaint before, but now is the moment. Lyle, greets me and says that he will handle my complaint, only to be informed that the previous member of Nike was wrong for offering a discount as compensation and I should instead order a different pair of shoes in the next online sale. Furthermore, it transpires that the repeated cancelled orders are due to their website not accurately displaying what it available to ship at the warehouse, this seems counterproductive for all involved, no? But the cherry on top, the piece de resistance: as this waste of time had now gone past 5pm (presumably), Lyle unilaterally terminates our chat mid-message. No apology and no conclusion, and frankly no care given.In the past I have owned plenty of great shoes from Nike, but I do not recommend ordering from Nike online. If you receive your shoes and they fit fine then that's great, but just know that should you run into any issues Nike are not remotely interested in whether or not you receive your order or have a positive shopping experience. Instead, I have bought from Asics, who I do recommend. Simple and hassle free. Don't give Nike your business, they don't want it.",1,Bad,2020-05-26,1,United Kingdom

Mandy,Infant white rift shoes - avoid!,"Bought white rift trainers for my 16mth old grandaughter from office uk, reviewing them too! Kids play & get dirty, these shoes come with no cleaning care instructons so they have been wiped down with a clean cloth & a touch of fairy non-bio, they are ruined, will not come clean, £40 down the drain. Why sell non-cleaning white shoes for infants? I think maybe my 3 adult men will avoid nike (and office) at all cost.

Two pairs of the same style of shoe received all bent out of shape?Nike know they are of dreadful quality but will do absolutely nothing about it.I am absolutely disgusted with there attitude and complete lack of customer service",1,Bad,2019-05-06,24,United Kingdom

Josh,"Oh gosh where to start, sort your life out Nike","Oh gosh where to start, 3 months, as many clothes orders. None of which were small orders. EVERY order atleast 2 items sent back due to the quality of the material (bobbling when washed within 2 weeks) or just the items were constructed badly. Also ordered trainers, and returned them before i even got them, as UPS doesnt know how to ring when unsure of location, and i wasnt in the mood to sit in all day again because UPS dont do delivery estimated times. Nike your ONLY saving grace is the customer services. Very friendly and helpful. Oh and i needed to exchange one item due to shoddly put together by one of nikes obscure location factorys (no arm hole elastic, arms too long and main body cut dodgy), sent the thing back YOU had it a week and ended up having to call customer services who couldnt understand why it hadnt been sent.

Josh,Whats happened to nikes quality,"Ive been a long time nike customer, for more years then i care to remember. So when it came time for a shopping spree dont need to guess where i went, along with the vast sums ive spent over the years. I bought some jogging bottoms and simular hoody, well 3 sets, of diffrent types/styles along with other things. All of a couple weeks of use and washing and the things are bobbled. The tshirts, boxers and even sox are perfectly fine. Also the quality an feel of the items is now dire, ive still got a zip hoody from 2 years ago (thats hasnt bobbled) feels much more substantal, thicker and overall better quality. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NIKE. Arnt companys ment to get better quality wise over time? The worst bit is you cant even email anyone to air your complaints, no email, phone lines are constantly busy. Luckly managed to speak to a lovely lady, who sorted the refund straight away, said she would speak to the higher ups about quality, heres hoping",1,Bad,2019-01-08,3,United Kingdom
